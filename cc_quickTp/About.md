This was created with the help of a tutorial, however I did add a significant amount of code on my own.

What the tutorial helped me with:
  -"/goto [targetId]" - Takes the player to another player.
  -"/summon [targetId]" - Brings the target player to the player.

What  I added:
  -"/tp [Location]" - Allows the player to teleport to Sandy, Grapeseed, LSIA, and Pelato. The code also set's the player's heading to an assigned value to avoid them from facing the
   wrong direction.
