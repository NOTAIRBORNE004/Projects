This was another project which I used months ago to learn Lua. Like the other scripts, this was lost when I switched my server pc and i recreated it to serve as a refresher with Lua.
The script displays the player's coordinates on the top right of their screen, along with their current heading. My profile picture is placed in the bottom right of the screen.
This is a script thats only function was to allow me to learn/refresh my memory with NUI. It was created with the help of a youtube tutorial.
