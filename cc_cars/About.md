This project was my first FiveM Lua project. It was created several months ago when I was first learning Lua, but was lost when switching my server. I recreated the script to help me
refresh my memory on Lua.

The script allows the player to enter "/spawn [modelname]" to spawn any vehicle of their choosing. This script is one of my more commonly used scripts on my testing server due to it's
speed when compared to spawning a vehicle through vMenu.
