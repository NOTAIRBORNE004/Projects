Over the last several months I have decided to learn Lua. I had previously done some entry level coding with Python, but otherwise I am a novice. Some of the scripts here were created with the help of youtube tutorials. If a script
was created with the help of a tutorial, it's mentioned in the About.md document. About.md contains a short description of the script and it's functionality. In scripts which I have identified but not corrected issues, I have added
a "Known Issues" section to annotate the problem. 

Scripts which used a youtube tutorial:
cc_carControl
cc_cars
cc_greeting (Default greeting feature added without tutorial)
cc_nui
cc_quickTp ("/tp" command added without tutorial, allowing players to go to Sandy, Grapeseed, LSIA, and Pelato)

Scripts which did not use a tutorial:
cc_dv
cc_environment
cc_money
cc_speed
