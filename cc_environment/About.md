This script implements two new commands. "/time" allows players to update the time to Morning, Noon, Day, Evening, or Night. "/weather" allows players to change the current weather. 
Players can type "/weather help' to view valid options.

Known Issues:
  - (Not technically and issue) The script in it's current form functions as expected, however would like to cut down on the redundant code. The format it's currently in was easy for
    me to create, which is why a lot of code currently repeats. In the future I plan on revisiting this and simplifying the script.
